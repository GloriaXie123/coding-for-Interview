# coding-for-Interview
i am a new programmer who is determined to become a algorithm engineer,i found john jwasham's github repository during my self-taught process to be a well-prepared algorithm engineer and was inspired a lot.thanks john for sharing your experience.i decide to build my own repository to record my experience too, i realize that well documented recod can help me outline what materials i need to digest,what pace i should take and what i have gone through during the process,to manage and also to self motivate.
