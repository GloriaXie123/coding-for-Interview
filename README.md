# coding-for-Interview
i am a new programmer who is determined to become a algorithm engineer,i found john jwasham's github repository during my self-taught process to be a well-prepared algorithm engineer and was inspired a lot.thanks john for sharing your experience.i decide to build my own repository to record my experience too, i realize that well documented recod can help me outline what materials i need to digest,what pace i should take and what i have gone through during the process,to manage and also to self motivate.

## collect the jd description,target the essential elememts for algorithm engineer
well,i kind of collect all the opening algorithm engineer jobs that i am interested,list them in a table showing their company,location,industy,job description and requirements,the requirements are what i am focusing on which varies a little bit by industry.however strong coding ability is basic and common requisite of all the job position.besides,main algorithms of the subtopics of artificial intelligience applications are also required.in additial to that,the toolkits of deep learning like tensorflow,pytorch and caffee are also mentioned.
