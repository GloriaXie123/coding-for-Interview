    ```
- create a dir as workspace in vscode,execute the follwing command from your command line terminal:
  ```
  mkdir projects
  cd projects
  mkdir HelloWorld
  cd HelloWorld
  code .
  ```
  *code*. opens vs code in the current folder,you can create a file named helloworld.c in the current folder or current workspace.
- compile source code:helloworld.c
  from the main menu of vs code,choose **Terminal -> Configure Default Build Task**ï¼Œthen run CTRL+SHIFT+B,the program will begin to complie.if you want to choose specific build task,you can choose **Terminal -> Run Build Task**,also the program will compile.
- run the executable program
